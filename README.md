# Ecommerce_DatabaseManagementSystem

My DBMS Project

A website UI made mostly using HTML and CSS. Used PHP for connecting it to the database. Requires XAMPP to create a local server and can run this project on their System. Database uses MySQL for performing queries including sorting and searching. 

The E-commerce Management is developed for sale/purchase organization. This system manages customer, product, sales order, and supplier and purchase order. It provides a platform to the trader to automate their record keeping.

The purpose of this project is to develop an application program to reduce the manual work formanaging inventory, product, customer, supplier and orders. This project is built to help admin in managing his organization.

Admin can store customer details in the database. Next time when customer comes in then there is no need to enter his details again. It can selected from the list displaying all customers.
